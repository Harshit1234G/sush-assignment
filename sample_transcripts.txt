Hi, I tried booking a slot yesterday but the payment failed and I was charged twice. This is really frustrating!
Hello, I booked a consultation for tomorrow. I just wanted to confirm the timing once again and check if I need to bring any documents along.
Hi, I just wanted to say the booking process was really smooth today. The agent helped me quickly, and I got my confirmation instantly. Thank you for the support!
Hello, I’ve been trying to reset my account password for three days. Every time I click on the reset link, it says expired. I contacted support via email but still haven’t received a working link. I need urgent access to complete my booking, and I’m getting very annoyed now.
Good afternoon, I wanted to let you know that the staff at your clinic was really polite when I visited last week. The consultation went fine. I do have one small concern though — the payment receipt hasn’t arrived in my email yet. Could you please resend it?
